Don't be discouraged, my friend. Our money matters, as I told you, leave me plenty of time to turn round in, and <em>I</em> may search for Anne Catherick to-morrow to better purpose than you.

But accident did not bring me near enough to see this same woman's face plainly. I must know how to recognise our invisible Anne. What is she like?"</p><p>"Like? Come! I'll tell you in two words. She's a sickly likeness of my wife."</p></div> </div>
