What sort of a man is this uncle? Old?"</p><p>"No—neither old nor young."</p><p>"A good-tempered, freely-living man? Married? No—I think my wife told me, not married."</p><p>"Of course not. If he was married, and had a son, Lady Glyde would not be next heir to the property. I'll tell you what he is. He's a maudlin, twaddling, selfish fool, and bores everybody who comes near him about the state of his health."</p><p>"Men of that sort, Percival, live long, and marry malevolently when you least expect it. I don't give you much, my friend, for your chance of the three thousand a year. Is there nothing more that comes to you from your wife?"</p></div> </div>
