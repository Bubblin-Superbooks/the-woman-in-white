Listen!"</p><p>I heard the sound too—a sound like a light footstep following us.</p><p>"No matter who it is, or what it is," I said, "let us walk on. In another minute, if there is anything to alarm us, we shall be near enough to the house to be heard."</p><p>We went on quickly—so quickly, that Laura was breathless by the time we were nearly through the plantation, and within sight of the lighted windows.</p><p>I waited a moment to give her breathing-time. Just as we were about to proceed she stopped me again, and signed to me with her hand to listen once more. We both heard distinctly a long, heavy sigh behind us, in the black depths of the trees.</p><p>"Who's there?" I called out.</p><p>There was no answer.</p></div> </div>
