<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">shocking circumstances which happened at a later period did not, I am thankful to say, happen in my presence. I do beg and entreat that nobody will be so very unfeeling as to lay any part of the blame of those circumstances on <em>me</em>. I did everything for the best. I am not answerable for a deplorable calamity, which it was quite impossible to foresee. I am shattered by itâ€”I have suffered under it, as nobody else has suffered. My servant, Louis (who is really attached to me in his unintelligent way), thinks I shall never get over it. He sees me dictating at this moment, with my handkerchief to my eyes. I wish to mention, in justice to myself, that it was not my fault, and that I am quite exhausted and heartbroken. Need I say more?</p></div> </div>
