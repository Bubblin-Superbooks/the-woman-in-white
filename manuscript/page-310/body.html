May I say, at parting, that it is the dear object of <em>my</em> hopes too?"</p><p>The tears flowed fast down her cheeks. She rested one trembling hand on the table to steady herself while she gave me the other. I took it in mine—I held it fast. My head drooped over it, my tears fell on it, my lips pressed it—not in love; oh, not in love, at that last moment, but in the agony and the self-abandonment of despair.</p><p>"For God's sake, leave me!" she said faintly.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">The confession of her heart's secret burst from her in those pleading words.
