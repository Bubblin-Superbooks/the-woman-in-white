To remember her, as I did, the liveliest, happiest child that ever laughed the day through, and to see her now, in the flower of her age and her beauty, so broken and so brought down as this!</p><p>In the distress that she caused me I forgot the years that had passed, and the change they had made in our position towards one another.

"Don't cry, my love," I said, and dried the tears that were gathering in her eyes with my own hand, as if she had been the little Laura Fairlie of ten long years ago.</p><p>It was the best way I could have taken to compose her.
