When the ladies had risen from table, and Mr. Gilmore and I were left alone in the dining-room, a new interest presented itself to occupy our attention, and to give me an opportunity of quieting myself by a few minutes of needful and welcome silence. The servant who had been despatched to trace Anne Catherick and Mrs. Clements returned with his report, and was shown into the dining-room immediately.</p><p>"Well," said Mr. Gilmore, "what have you found out?"</p><p>"I have found out, sir," answered the man, "that both the women took tickets at our station here for Carlisle."</p><p>"You went to Carlisle, of course, when you heard that?"</p><p>"I did, sir, but I am sorry to say I could find no further trace of them."</p></div> </div>
