"I am at a loss to know what that business can possibly be."</p><p>The unconcealed curiosity, with which he looked hard in my face while he spoke, convinced me that I had passed unnoticed by him at the Opera. He had seen Pesca first, and from that moment till he left the theatre he had evidently seen nothing else. My name would necessarily suggest to him that I had not come into his house with other than a hostile purpose towards himself, but he appeared to be utterly ignorant thus far of the real nature of my errand.</p><p>"I am fortunate in finding you here to-night," I said. "You seem to be on the point of taking a journey?"</p><p>"Is your business connected with my journey?"</p><p>"In some degree."</p><p>"In what degree? Do you know where I am going to?"</p><p>"No. I only know why you are leaving London."</p></div> </div>
