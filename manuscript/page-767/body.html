"Some little difficulty, perhaps. I am thinking of the safest way of putting my two letters into Fanny's hands."</p><p>"You have really written them, then? Oh, Marian, run no risks—pray, pray run no risks!"</p><p>"No, no—no fear. Let me see—what o'clock is it now?"</p><p>It was a quarter to six. There would be time for me to get to the village inn, and to come back again before dinner. If I waited till the evening I might find no second opportunity of safely leaving the house.</p><p>"Keep the key turned in the lock. Laura," I said, "and don't be afraid about me. If you hear any inquiries made, call through the door, and say that I am gone out for a walk."</p><p>"When shall you be back?"</p></div> </div>
