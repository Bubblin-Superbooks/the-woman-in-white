<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">new day!</p><p>Why do I sit here still? Why do I weary my hot eyes and my burning head by writing more? Why not lie down and rest myself, and try to quench the fever that consumes me, in sleep?</p><p>I dare not attempt it. A fear beyond all other fears has got possession of me. I am afraid of this heat that parches my skin. I am afraid of the creeping and throbbing that I feel in my head. If I lie down now, how do I know that I may have the sense and the strength to rise again?</p><p>Oh, the rain, the rain—the cruel rain that chilled me last night!</p><p>Nine o'clock. Was it nine struck, or eight? Nine, surely? I am shivering again—shivering, from head to foot, in the summer air. Have I been sitting here asleep? I don't know what I have been doing.</p><p>Oh, my God! am I going to be ill?</p></div> </div>
