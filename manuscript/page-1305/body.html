Three of them opposite to me were holding lanterns low down to the ground. Their eyes, and the eyes of all the rest, were fixed silently and expectantly on my face. I knew what was at my feet—I knew why they were holding the lanterns so low to the ground.</p><p>"Can you identify him, sir?"</p><p>My eyes dropped slowly.

I looked up, along the cloth, and there at the end, stark and grim and black, in the yellow light—there was his dead face.</p><p>So, for the first and last time, I saw him. So the Visitation of God ruled it that he and I should meet.</p></div> </div>
