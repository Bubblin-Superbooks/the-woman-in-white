"The fool's crime is the crime that is found out, and the wise man's crime is the crime that is <em>not</em> found out. If I could give you an instance, it would not be the instance of a wise man. Dear Lady Glyde, your sound English common sense has been too much for me. It is checkmate for <em>me</em> this time, Miss Halcombeâ€”ha?"</p><p>"Stand to your guns, Laura," sneered Sir Percival, who had been listening in his place at the door. "Tell him next, that crimes cause their own detection. There's another bit of copy-book morality for you, Fosco. Crimes cause their own detection. What infernal humbug!"</p><p>"I believe it to be true," said Laura quietly.</p></div> </div>
